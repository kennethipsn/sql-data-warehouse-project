## About Me

Hi, I'm **Kenneth Ssempala Nsubuga**. My background is Furniture and product design. Experienced Furniture maker and Joinery CAD Technician. Beginning of **2022**, I started working with software like **Fusion 360**, **AutoCAD**, **[F4®Integrate - Felder Group](https://www.felder-group.com/en-gb/products/f4solutions-software-c596305/software-f4integrate-p596313)**, **[Cabinet Vision & AlphaCAM](https://hexagon.com/products/product-groups/computer-aided-manufacturing-cad-cam-software)**, **Adobe Illustrator**. My General job requirements were, to prepare technical design and machining data (including CAM programming and CNC ready machining programs), drawings for CNC machining manufacture and manual Assembly.

Over the years I've found that the various softwares used through the design tp manufacture process are either cumbersome or expensive. 

As well as this being a journey to grow my proficiency in the 'coding' it is also the 'vehicular-academy' guiding me closer to devising solutions to problems ive encountered daily as a professional.
